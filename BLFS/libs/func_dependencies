# This is a set of (recursive) functions for manipulating a dependency graph. #
# We use algorithms and definitions from chapter 4 (mainly section 4.2) of    #
# https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/. The graph we manipulate is the directed    #
# graph of the dependencies: nodes are packages in the BLFS book. A node A is #
# connected to a node B if package A depends on B. A topological order (rev-  #
# erted) is exactly what we want for a build order. But a topological order   #
# only exists if the graph is acyclic. We'll therefore have to remove cycles. #
# There are a number of other features we want to consider:                   #
# - edges are weighted according to the dependency requirement:               #
#   1 for required                                                            #
#   2 for recommended                                                         #
#   3 for optional                                                            #
#   4 for external                                                            #
#   We should consider only edges with weight lower or equal to that          #
#   specified by the user, but see below.                                     #
# - we do not want to build the whole book. The user specifies a set of       #
#   packages, and we have to consider only nodes reachable from this set      #
#   using edges of weight not exceeding the specified weight.                 #
# - when doing the topological sort, we want to consider all the edges and    #
#   not only those not exceeding the specified weight: If a package A in the  #
#   reachable subgraph depends optionally on another package B in the same    #
#   subgraph, we want to build B before A. But this means we'll have to       #
#   remove cycles for all weights.                                            #
# - dependencies have another qualifier: before or after. The problem: if a   #
#   package A depends on B with an "after" qualifier, and a package C depends #
#   on A with a "before" qualifier, C may need B to be able to use A. So the  #
#   only safe way to consider "after" qualifiers is to consider that they are #
#   "before" deps for any parent of the packages considered.                  #
# We'll therefore have a 3 pass procedure. First build the set of nodes       #
# reachable from the root set. Second, remove dangling edges (those pointing  #
# to packages outside the node set), and move "after" edges to "before" edges #
# originating from the parents. Third remove cycles and generate a            #
# topological sort.                                                           #
#                                                                             #
# TODO: document each pass
# Data layout:                                                                #
# TODO: needs also to document the .tree files, and the "f" qualifier
#                                                                             #
# A node of the tree is represented by a text file <nodeName>.dep. Each edge  #
# starting from this node is represented by a line in this file. We keep      #
# those files in the same directory. We introduce a special node named root,  #
# whose edges point to the list of nodes requested by the user. Each line     #
# contains three fields:                                                      #
#  - the weight of the edge                                                   #
#  - the "before" (b) or "after" (a) qualifier                                #
#  - the name of the destination of the edge                                  #
#                                                                           #

# In case we find a cirdular dependency, it has the form :                  #
# parent->dependency_0->...->dependency_n->dependency_0                     #
# If we want to build dependency_n before dependency_0, no problem:         #
# we just prune the tree at dependency_n. If we want to build first         #
# dependency_0, we need to put dependency_n as a dependency of parent,      #
# then erase and rebuild the subtree from there. Now, we may have met       #
# another circular dependency in the subtree, and erasing the tree makes    #
# us forget the decision which was made. So, after first generating the     #
# list of dependencies from packages.xml, we keep the generated list in     #
# a file <nodeName>.odep, which we modify according to the decision which   #
# was made.                                                                 #
