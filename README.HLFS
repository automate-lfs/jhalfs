		::::NOTICE::::

 Hardened Linux From Scratch is a highly volatile project. Extreme design
 changes can occur and the build could be broken for extended periods of
 time.

 As of Feb.18.2007 jhalfs cannot build the SVN or 2.4-branch book.
 This is a book problem and not a jhalfs bug.


 Build failures detected:

   -.Several patches are missing or have a bad MD5 sum, thus the tool
     is unable to start and test the builds.
