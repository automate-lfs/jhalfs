#--- Default optimization mode
#    This level is overridden by definitions in opt_override;
#    in this way, packages can be tuned independently.  For example,
#    if you have trouble building a package in mode defOpt, add
#    the package to opt_override with a different mode.
DEF_OPT_LVL=defOpt


#--- Active optimization variables
#    Variables listed here will be set as defined in the appropriate
#    file in opt_config.d/; others will be ignored.
ACTIVE_OPT_VARS="CFLAGS CXXFLAGS LDFLAGS \
                 OTHER_CFLAGS OTHER_CXXFLAGS OTHER_LDFLAGS"

#--- Load optimization modes
#    To add modes, create a working template..
#      cp opt_config.d/defOpt opt_config.d/newMode
#    ..and edit it as desired.
#
#    To inherit another mode and add to it, see opt_config.d/defOpt_fPIC
#    as an example.  Given opt_config.d/modeA_modeB_modeC, modeB inherits
#    the optimizations of modeA by sourcing it, and modeC inherits those
#    of modeB (which includes those of modeA).
#
#    Add packages that are to use this mode to opt_override with:
#      echo 'myPkg  newMode' >> opt_override
for mode in optimize/opt_config.d/* ; do
  source $mode
done
