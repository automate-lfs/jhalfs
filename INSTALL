Installation Instructions
*************************

If you plan to use the packages download feature of jhalfs and
your host system uses a md5sum program that doesn't accept '-'
as a file name, like the one shipped with Debian 3.1 stable,
apply the included patch, issuing:

patch -Np0 < jhalfs-0.2-debian_31_as_host-1.patch

jhalfs can be used directly from the sources directory, or
installed system-wide.

To install jhalfs system-wide issue as root:

make install

That will install the jhalfs script under /usr/bin, the
configuration file under /etc/jhalfs, and the style sheet,
functions and README files under /usr/share/jhalfs.

To customize the installation locations, the following environment
variables can be used:

BIN=/some/path      Define where the jhalfs script will be
                    installed

CONFIG=/some/path   Define where the configuration file will be
                    installed

DATA=/some/path     Define where the additional files will be
                    installed

For example, to install the program and files into root's home:

make BIN=/root/bin CONFIG=/root/jhalfs DATA=/root/jhalfs
